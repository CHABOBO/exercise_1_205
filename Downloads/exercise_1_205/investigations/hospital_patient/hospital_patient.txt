hospital_patient

CONCLUSION:
WHY APPROACH APP AND HOW RESULTS SUPPORT APPROACH:

FOR this query I wanted to show patients key elements about each facility that would be pertinent to an incoming patient. A patient should be able to search by condition, state, score of the hospital, hospital name and type to find viable hospitals and then use the remaining variables to compare current choices. This query assumes that with city and state the patient will be able to search for address via the web, the query also assumes that the patient will be interested in comparing hospitals by region and decide on what hospital to go to based off of survey feedback. The results show emergency departments in AK.
