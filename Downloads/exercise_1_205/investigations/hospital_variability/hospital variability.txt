hospital variability

CONCLUSION:
WHY APPROACH APP AND HOW RESULTS SUPPORT APPROACH:
For this query I aimed to show the variability in results for hospitals and amongst hospitals. Hospitals can have varying survey hcahps scores, but for the purpose of reviewing discrepent rankings I AVG the scores to show variability amongst hospitals and focused on readmission scoring. A hospital can be both worse and no different compared to national and have varying average readmission scores. Additional review of the data can show more variability, but for the purpose of the assignment we leave it to 10.
