Again I qualify Best State by the readmit compared to national score, then the state's average of HCAHPS base and consistency scores. I have not taken into consideration the number of hospitals in each state, more nor have I taken into consideration the type of hospitals available in each state. In a follow up analysis it would be good to consider the count of how many were better than the national minus how many were lower than the national.
